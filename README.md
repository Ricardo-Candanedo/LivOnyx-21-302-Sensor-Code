# LivOnyx-21-302-Sensor-Code

Provided in this repo is the sensor_code.ino for the Arduino, the example used to help me write the code, and the .h zip file that was used within the code. Both the .h file and the SR04 example are not owned by me, but by the company who makes the sensor, Elegoo, that was going to be used in our inital design. The name of the sensor is the HC-SR04, which is an ultrasonic sensor. I will also provide the datasheet for this sensor in this repository as well.
